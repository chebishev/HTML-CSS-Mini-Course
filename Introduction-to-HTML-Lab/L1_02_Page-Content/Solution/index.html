        <h3>Just Another Day</h3>
        <p><i>Written by Christina on January 11th</i></p>
        <p>This is my second blog entry, and I just wanted to check in on you. I published my first article about
            business
            blogging in August, 2001. You can read it here. Whew. A lot of water under the bridge since then,
            including 9/11, which happened only a few weeks later.</p>
